Students,
I had a student as a question about how to create a dropdown list, so I figured I'd pass this along to everyone.
There are a number of ways this can be done.  The easiest way is to use an enumeration.  Then use the EnumDropDownlistFor helper method to display the enum values in a dropdown.  
Here is one example that create a dropdown list for an enumeration.  
Here is what you need to do...
1. Create an enum like...
    public enum AdminDecisionType
    {
        New,
        Waitlist, 
        Accepted,
        Rejected,
    }

2.  Add a new property to you Applicant class
        public AdminDecisionType AdminDecision { get; set; }


3.  Using package Manager Console,add new migration and update Database
Add-Migration admin-decision
Update-Database
4.  Re-generate your views or manually add calls to @Html.EnumDropDownlostfor() helper
     <div class="form-group">
            @Html.LabelFor(model => model.AdminDecision, htmlAttributes: new { @class = "control-label col-md-2" })
           
md-10">
                @Html.EnumDropDownListFor(model => model.AdminDecision, htmlAttributes: new { @class = "form-control" })
                @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.AdminDecision, "", new { @class = "text-danger" })
            </div>
        </div>
